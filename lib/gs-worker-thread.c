/**
 * SECTION:gs-worker-thread
 * @short_description: A worker thread which executes queued #GTasks until stopped
 *
 * #GsWorkerThread is a thread-safe wrapper around a #GTask queue and a single
 * worker thread which executes tasks on that queue.
 *
 * Tasks can be added to the queue using gs_worker_thread_queue(). The worker
 * thread (which is created when #GsWorkerThread is constructed) will execute
 * them in (priority, queue order) order. Each #GTaskThreadFunc is responsible
 * for calling `g_task_return_*()` on its #GTask to complete that task.
 *
 * The priority passed to gs_worker_thread_queue() will be used to adjust the
 * worker thread’s I/O priority (using `ioprio_set()`) when executing that task.
 *
 * It is intended that gs_worker_thread_queue() is an alternative to using
 * g_task_run_in_thread(). g_task_run_in_thread() queues tasks into a single
 * process-wide thread pool, so they are mixed in with other tasks, and it can
 * become hard to ensure the thread pool isn’t overwhelmed and that tasks are
 * executed in the right order.
 *
 * The worker thread will continue executing tasks until
 * gs_worker_thread_shutdown_async() is called. This must be called before the
 * final reference to the #GsWorkerThread is dropped.
 *
 * Since: 42
