        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
          At the heart of gnome software the application is just a plugin loader
          that has some GTK UI that gets created for various result types.
          The idea is we have lots of small plugins that each do one thing and
          then pass the result onto the other plugins.
          These are ordered by dependencies against each other at runtime and
          each one can do things like editing an existing application or adding a
          new application to the result set.
          This is how we can add support for things like firmware updating,
          Steam, GNOME Shell web-apps and flatpak bundles without making big
          changes all over the source tree.
        </para>
        <para>
          There are broadly 3 types of plugin methods:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="strong">Actions</emphasis>: Do something on a specific GsApp</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="strong">Refine</emphasis>: Get details about a specific GsApp</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="strong">Adopt</emphasis>: Can this plugin handle this GsApp</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
          In general, building things out-of-tree isn't something that I think is
          a very good idea; the API and ABI inside gnome-software is still
          changing and there's a huge benefit to getting plugins upstream where
          they can undergo review and be ported as the API adapts.
          I'm also super keen to provide configurability in GSettings for doing
          obviously-useful things, the sort of thing Fleet Commander can set for
          groups of users.
        </para>
        <para>
          However, now we're shipping gnome-software in enterprise-class distros
          we might want to allow customers to ship their own plugins to make
          various business-specific changes that don't make sense upstream.
          This might involve querying a custom LDAP server and changing the
          suggested apps to reflect what groups the user is in, or might involve
          showing a whole new class of applications that does not conform to the
          Linux-specific <emphasis>application is a desktop-file</emphasis> paradigm.
          This is where a plugin makes sense.
        </para>

        <para>
          The plugin only needs to define the vfuncs that are required, and the
          plugin name is taken automatically from the suffix of the
          <filename>.so</filename> file.

          We have to define when our plugin is run in reference to other plugins,
          in this case, making sure we run before <code>appstream</code>.
          As we're such a simple plugin we're relying on another plugin to run
          after us to actually make the GsApp <emphasis>complete</emphasis>,
          i.e. loading icons and setting a localised long description.
        </para>
        <para>
          In this example we want to show GIMP as a result (from any provider,

          <code>fotoshop</code>.

        <title>Distribution Specific Functionality</title>
        <para>
          Some plugins should only run on specific distributions, for instance
          the <code>ubuntu-reviews</code> plugin should only be used on Ubuntu
          systems.
          This can be achieved with a simple runtime check using the helper
          <code>gs_plugin_check_distro_id()</code> method or the <code>GsOsRelease</code>
          object where more complicated rules are required.

          Next is returning custom applications in the installed list.
          The use case here is a proprietary software distribution method that
          installs custom files into your home directory, but you can use your
          imagination for how this could be useful.
          The example here is all hardcoded, and a true plugin would have to
          derive the details about the GsApp, for example reading in an XML
          file or YAML config file somewhere.

            <para>
              The application ID (<code>example:chiron.desktop</code>) has a
              prefix of <code>example</code> which means we can co-exist with
              any package or flatpak version of the Chiron application,
              not setting the prefix would make the UI confused if more than
              one <code>chiron.desktop</code> got added.

            <para>
              Most applications want a kind of <code>AS_APP_KIND_DESKTOP</code>

              kudos to award to deserving apps.

          To show this fake application just compile and install the plugin,

      <section>
        <title>Downloading Metadata and Updates</title>

        <para>
          The plugin loader supports a <code>gs_plugin_refresh()</code> vfunc that
          is called in various situations.
          To ensure plugins have the minimum required metadata on disk it is
          called at startup, but with a cache age of <emphasis>infinite</emphasis>.
          This basically means the plugin must just ensure that
          <emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis> data exists no matter what the age.
        </para>
        <para>
          Usually once per hour, we'll call <code>gs_plugin_refresh()</code> but
          with the correct cache age set (typically a little over 24 hours) which
          allows the plugin to download new metadata or payload files from remote
          servers.
          The <code>gs_utils_get_file_age()</code> utility helper can help you
          work out the cache age of file, or the plugin can handle it some other
          way.
        </para>
        <para>
          For the Flatpak plugin we just make sure the AppStream metadata exists
          at startup, which allows us to show search results in the UI.
          If the metadata did not exist (e.g. if the user had added a remote
          using the command-line without gnome-software running) then we would
          show a loading screen with a progress bar before showing the main UI.
          On fast connections we should only show that for a couple of seconds,
          but it's a good idea to try any avoid that if at all possible in the
          plugin.
          Once per day the <code>gs_plugin_refresh()</code> method is called again,
          but this time with <code>GS_PLUGIN_REFRESH_FLAGS_PAYLOAD</code> set.
          This is where the Flatpak plugin would download any ostree trees (but
          not doing the deploy step) so that the applications can be updated live
          in the details panel without having to wait for the download to complete.
          In a similar way, the fwupd plugin downloads the tiny LVFS metadata with
          <code>GS_PLUGIN_REFRESH_FLAGS_METADATA</code> and then downloads the
          large firmware files themselves only when the
          <code>GS_PLUGIN_REFRESH_FLAGS_PAYLOAD</code> flag is set.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the <code>@app</code> parameter is set for
          <code>gs_plugin_download_file()</code> then the progress of the download
          is automatically proxied to the UI elements associated with the
          application, for instance the install button would show a progress bar
          in the various different places in the UI.
          For a refresh there's no relevant GsApp to use, so we'll leave it
          <code>NULL</code> which means something is happening globally which the
          UI can handle how it wants, for instance showing a loading page at startup.
        </para>
        <para>
          Note, if the downloading fails it's okay to return <code>FALSE</code>;
          the plugin loader continues to run all plugins and just logs an error
          to the console. We'll be calling into <code>gs_plugin_refresh()</code>
          again in only another hour, so there's no need to bother the user.
          For actions like <code>gs_plugin_app_install</code> we also do the same
          thing, but we also save the error on the GsApp itself so that the UI is
          free to handle that how it wants, for instance showing a GtkDialog
          window for example.

        <title>Adding Application Information Using Refine</title>

        <para>
          As previous examples have shown it's very easy to add a new
          application to the search results, updates list or installed list.
          Some plugins don't want to add more applications, but want to modify
          existing applications to add more information depending on what is
          required by the UI code.
          The reason we don't just add everything at once is that for
          search-as-you-type to work effectively we need to return results in
          less than about 50ms and querying some data can take a long time.
          For example, it might take a few hundred ms to work out the download
          size for an application when a plugin has to also look at what
          dependencies are already installed.
          We only need this information once the user has clicked the search
          results and when the user is in the details panel, so we can save a
          ton of time not working out properties that are not useful.

          This is a simple example, but shows what a plugin needs to do.
          It first checks if the action is required, in this case
          <code>GS_PLUGIN_REFINE_FLAGS_REQUIRE_LICENSE</code>.
          This request is more common than you might expect as even the search
          results shows a non-free label if the license is unspecified or
          non-free.
          It then checks if the license is already set, returning with success
          if so.
          If not, it checks the application ID and hardcodes a license; in the
          real world this would be querying a database or parsing an additional
          config file.
          As mentioned before, if the license value is freely available without
          any extra work then it's best just to set this at the same time as
          when adding the app with <code>gs_app_list_add()</code>.
          Think of refine as <emphasis>adding things that cost time to
          calculate only when really required</emphasis>.

          The UI in gnome-software is quite forgiving for missing data, hiding
          sections or labels as required.
          Some things are required however, and forgetting to assign an icon or
          short description will get the application vetoed so that it's not
          displayed at all.
          Helpfully, running <code>gnome-software --verbose</code> on the
          command line will tell you why an application isn't shown along with
          any extra data.

        <title>Adopting AppStream Applications</title>

        <para>
          There's a lot of flexibility in the gnome-software plugin structure;
          a plugin can add custom applications and handle things like search and
          icon loading in a totally custom way.
          Most of the time you don't care about how search is implemented or how
          icons are going to be loaded, and you can re-use a lot of the existing
          code in the <code>appstream</code> plugin.
          To do this you just save an AppStream-format XML file in either
          <filename>/usr/share/app-info/xmls/</filename>,
          <filename>/var/cache/app-info/xmls/</filename> or
          <filename>~/.local/share/app-info/xmls/</filename>.
          GNOME Software will immediately notice any new files, or changes to
          existing files as it has set up the various inotify watches.
        </para>
        <para>
          This allows plugins to care a lot less about how applications are
          going to be shown.
          For example, the <code>steam</code> plugin downloads and parses the
          descriptions from a remote service during
          <code>gs_plugin_refresh()</code>, and also finds the best icon types
          and downloads them too.
          Then it exports the data to an AppStream XML file, saving it to your
          home directory.
          This allows all the applications to be easily created (and then refined)
          using something as simple as <code>gs_app_new("steam:foo.desktop")</code>.
          All the search tokenisation and matching is done automatically,
          so it makes the plugin much simpler and faster.
        </para>
        <para>
          The only extra step the steam plugin needs to do is implement the
          <code>gs_plugin_adopt_app()</code> function.
          This is called when an application does not have a management plugin
          set, and allows the plugin to <emphasis>claim</emphasis> the
          application for itself so it can handle installation, removal and
          updating.
          In the case of steam it could check the ID has a prefix of
          <code>steam:</code> or could check some other plugin-specific metadata
          using <code>gs_app_get_metadata_item()</code>.
        </para>
        <para>
          Another good example is the <code>fwupd</code> that wants to handle
          any firmware we've discovered in the AppStream XML.
          This might be shipped by the vendor in a package using Satellite,
          or downloaded from the LVFS. It wouldn't be kind to set a management
          plugin explicitly in case XFCE or KDE want to handle this in a
          different way. This adoption function in this case is trivial:
        </para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
void
gs_plugin_adopt_app (GsPlugin *plugin, GsApp *app)
{
  if (gs_app_get_kind (app) == AS_APP_KIND_FIRMWARE)
    gs_app_set_management_plugin (app, "fwupd");
}
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </section>

        <title>Using The Plugin Cache</title>

        <para>
          GNOME Software used to provide a per-process plugin cache,
          automatically de-duplicating applications and trying to be smarter
          than the plugins themselves.
          This involved merging applications created by different plugins and
          really didn't work very well.
          For versions 3.20 and later we moved to a per-plugin cache which
          allows the plugin to control getting and adding applications to the
          cache and invalidating it when it made sense.
          This seems to work a lot better and is an order of magnitude less
          complicated.
          Plugins can trivially be ported to using the cache using something
          like this:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
   /* create new object */
   id = gs_plugin_flatpak_build_id (inst, xref);
-  app = gs_app_new (id);
+  app = gs_plugin_cache_lookup (plugin, id);
+  if (app == NULL) {
+     app = gs_app_new (id);
+     gs_plugin_cache_add (plugin, id, app);
+  }
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
          Using the cache has two main benefits for plugins.
          The first is that we avoid creating duplicate GsApp objects for the
          same logical thing.
          This means we can query the installed list, start installing an
          application, then query it again before the install has finished.
          The GsApp returned from the second <code>add_installed()</code>
          request will be the same GObject, and thus all the signals connecting
          up to the UI will still be correct.
          This means we don't have to care about <emphasis>migrating</emphasis>
          the UI widgets as the object changes and things like progress bars just
          magically work.
        </para>
        <para>
          The other benefit is more obvious.
          If we know the application state from a previous request we don't have
          to query a daemon or do another blocking library call to get it.
          This does of course imply that the plugin is properly invalidating
          the cache using <code>gs_plugin_cache_invalidate()</code> which it
          should do whenever a change is detected.
          Whether a plugin uses the cache for this reason is up to the plugin,
          but if it does it is up to the plugin to make sure the cache doesn't
          get out of sync.
